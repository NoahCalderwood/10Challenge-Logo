# 10Challenge-Logo
  

  ## Description
  
  My motivation is to create a simple logo.
  This project was built so i did not have to pay for a logo.
  It solves the problem of not having a logo.
  During this project I learned how to use back-end programming to create images in SVG as well as used and became more familiar with skills I had learned in the past lessons.
